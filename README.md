# NixOS Personal Configuration

This repository contains the starting configuration files for setting up NixOS. It is intended to serve as a base configuration for me with some simple configurations.
You can modify the files in this directory to fine-tune your system based on your systems hardware and personal preferences.

## Installation

Copy the repo into your /etc/nixos folder.
